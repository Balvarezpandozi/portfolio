        Hello there, nice to meet you! let me tell you a little about my story.
        I am from Venezuela, a South-American country that is going through a
        tough time. Which is the reason why I immigrated to the United States of
        America to pursue my goals. Currently, I am working on graduating with a
        Bachelors in
        <b>Computer Science</b>. During this process, I have been also learning
        different skills you can check by scrolling down. I love
        <b>programming</b>, it is amazing to me how I am able to transform
        abstract ideas into software, <b>making the complex simple</b> . I enjoy
        sharing my knowledge as well as <b>creating</b> and <b>innovating</b>.

        <p>
          The first programming language I started learning was Java at my
          university. I realized that I could create Android applications with
          it and that is how I developed my knowledge with <b>Java</b>. The
          second programming language I learned, and the one that I used the
          most right now, was JavaScript. I was interested in web development,
          and many people and online resources suggested <b>JavaScript</b> for
          this purpose. So, I dived into it. Also, I have been curious about
          Python. That is why I have learned the main subjects about the languge
          and created some small programs with <b>Python</b>. Finally, <b>C++</b> is a language that I have been required to use in many of my courses at my university. I have learned the basics of the language and I am currently learning more about it.

        <p>
          I was born in Venezuela, a Spanish speaking country. So,
          <b>Spanish</b> is my first language. I studied English for a year in
          my home country before coming to the United States. I lived in Iowa
          for a while, where I exposed myself to the language as much as I
          could. Then, I started my university program and became academically,
          socially, and professionally proficient at the
          <b>English</b> language.

        <h3 class="skills-header">📱 Web development</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoy <b>Web Development</b>. I have prior experience with designing that
          helps me with front-end development. However, I like more working on
          back-end development because it is more challenging, in my opinion.
          Usually, I use <b>Javascript</b>, <b>HTML</b>, and <b>CSS</b>. Also, I
          often work with <b>Boostrap</b> and <b>JQuery</b> because they are
          great tools for front-end development. As an illustration of this, I
          created this website you are looking at right now. For the backend, I
          often work with <b>Node JS</b> and NoSQL databases such as
          <b>Mongo DB</b>.

            TeamFluidFlow is a
            <span class="project-span">web application</span> designed to help
            team leaders manage and track their team performance in projects.
            Users can create projects, add team members, create and assigned
            tasks to them and so on. This app shows my ability to work in a full
            functional website. Including authentication and authorization. I am
            constantly updating this website to make it more robust. I use it
            myself to manage projects where I work alone or with a team. I hope
            you enjoy it and becomes a helpful tool as a team leader.

            Wireshark Clone is a <span class="project-span">Java Application</span> that copies core functionality from the widely used network protocol analyzer Wireshark. Just like Wireshark, this application captures and displays network traffic. It allows to write and read pcap files, filter packets and so on. This project was developed as a final project for the Software Design course at the University of Houston. I worked in a team of 3 people. I led the project dividing tasks and making sure the code was clean and cohesive.

          <p>
            This Python interpreter parses, process, and executes Python files by doing three passes to the input. It takes all characters and creates tokens for every element, such as identifiers, numbers, booleans, conditionals, functions and so on. Then it runs through the tokens and places them in order inside of an Abstract Syntax Tree. Finally, it executes the code by traversing the tree and executing the nodes. This project was developed as a final project for the Programming Languages and Paradigms course at the University of Houston. This project exposed me to C++ and the concepts of compilers and interpreters.

            students manage their tasks better. This app is based on a time
            managing system called "Get Things Done" (GTD). The app's goal is to
            improve students' time managing and efficiency so that they
            accomplish more in less time. Also, the GTD system avoids users to
            forget their tasks in the app. If used correctly, students will
            surely get things done.
