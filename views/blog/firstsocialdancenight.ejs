        <p>Welcome! I appreciate you, my amazing reader. If you‚Äôre an experienced social dancer. I‚Äôm afraid you might find this repetitive and obvious. There should be other articles in this blog that you‚Äôd enjoy reading! <a href="/blog" target="_blank"><span class="link-bold">(Check them out here)</span></a> Nevertheless, you‚Äôre welcome to stay and share your opinion. Let‚Äôs get to the meat of today‚Äôs subject. I am writing this to encourage you, first timer, to go social dancing. So, here you have some info on what to expect, how to prepare and some tips and stories to get you wired up and ready to move that butt the whole night.</p>
        <p>Let‚Äôs start by telling you how a social dancing event looks like.</p>
        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p>When you go out social dancing you can expect the following basic things: there is going to be other people that know how to dance ü™©, there‚Äôs going to be music to dance to üé∫, and people are going to dance with each other üëØ. After all, social dancing is already a pretty descriptive name.</p>
        <p>In any social dancing event, you will find a wide range of people. There will be beginners. There will be intermediate dancers. There will be advanced dancers. They will dance different music styles such as bachata or salsa. They will have diverse ethnic backgrounds. Not only Hispanics like some people might assume. They will have different levels of extroversion and/or introversion. And most importantly most of them will be there to dance.</p>
        <p>There‚Äôs going to be music to dance to üé∂. Depending on the event there might be a live band playing salsa all night üé∏, or maybe a DJ blasting bachata until people‚Äôs hips fall off üéß, or maybe there is a random dude plugged in to the speaker playing his ‚ÄúSuper amazing <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5RcbGZMFEZCEcMAvedCYUk?si=6e2066f1bae94a7a" target="_blank"><span class="link-bold">salsa</span></a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1FeTQKXpbec86Cw79Sx4u9?si=9db1258d95e34185" target="_blank"><span class="link-bold">bachata playlist</span></a>‚Äù. Whatever it is, there will be music playing.</p>
        <p>Obviously, you also should expect people dancing. People will ask other people to dance constantly. It is a common trend for leads to ask followers to dance. So, consequently if you‚Äôre a follow you will have a hard time taking a seat. Leads also get asked to dance less often. You will see couples dancing to the basic steps, and you will see couples doing the craziest moves. You will have dances that you enjoy, and you will have dances that you dislike. In a nutshell, this is social dancing!</p>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>To have a great experience your first-time social dancing, you should keep a couple of things in mind. <span class="navy-bold">Be hygienic, bring comfortable clothes, get a couple of steps in mind to do on the dance floor</span>.</p>
        <p>I hope this is evident but shower beforehand, smell good have fresh breath, wear deodorant. You do not want to repel dancers with your smell ü§¢.</p>
        <p>Bring comfortable clothes. Yes, you can look nice but make sure that you can move around in your amazing outfit. That top might be super cute üëó but if your boobs come off of it every time you turn, they might not be the right top for dancing. Or that button down üï∂Ô∏è that shows perfectly your huge bicep, and your big chest but it does not let you move your arm above your belly button might not be the best decision. Same with shoes, wear shoes that allow you to move on the dance floor comfortably. Even jewelry can get in the way sometimes. When choosing your social dancing outfit, just be mindful that your body will vigorously move a lot while dancing.</p>
        <p><span class="navy-bold">(Leads)</span> I suggest you get a couple of moves you feel comfortable with before you go out social dancing. Whatever dance it is, get your basic moves and maybe one turn or two. You don‚Äôt need 105.72 moves to go social dancing. You need basic moves that you feel comfortable with. One well done simple move is worth many complicated badly led moves. Like everything in life, practice and experience will give you more moves but for this first time keep it simple. Do what you know, practice and enjoy leading and connecting with different partners.</p>
        <p><span class="navy-bold">(Follows)</span> Also practice your basics. When you go out there focus on following whatever your partner leads you into. Most likely once they start dancing with you, they will be able to tell what kind of moves you can and cannot do. Focus on following and do your basics if you make mistakes that is fine you laugh it off and keep dancing. That‚Äôs where you learn.</p>
        <p>I have plenty of experience bringing first timers to social dancing. I have seen their experiences go great, bad, awful, sad, amazing, and so on. One thing is common between them all, it is intimidating. When you‚Äôre a beginner and you go out dancing and plenty of people are doing moves that you don‚Äôt quite understand and/or you think are super impressive and you have no clue how they do that of course you will feel intimidated. Therefore, it is important to remember that they were all in your shoes before. At some point they didn‚Äôt know this. Just try your best, don‚Äôt be afraid to ask anybody to dance. Get yourself a couple of dances and leave whenever you feel like it.</p>
