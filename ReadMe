Views directory: contains all the html files that the application will show as well as the partials and layouts.
Views > layouts: contains a boilerplate for every page on the website

Public > res > images: contains all the full quality images the the website utilizes

Issues that were simple to solve but took me hours to figure out:

- Images, scripts, stylesheets were not loading when I added route blog/:article. The solution was to add a "/" before all these elements on the HTMLs for the website. 
    - Time to figure out 3 hours. 
    - Frustration level 7 out of 10. 
    - Solving satisfaction 10 out of 10.
    - Lesson learned: Express static is annoying. Next time if you get stuck for more than 30 minutes start googling. It didn't directly help for this but it drove my attention to other parts of the code.
